Hello and this is my first post!

I am not sure yet what I am going to post over here since this is my first time making a blog that I will actually update from time to time.

The new blog runs Astro instead of Next.js, which was used on the old blog since I want to actually write markdown instead of using a .json file with all the posts inside. Since this is the first time using Astro, I won’t use the fancy features that Astro has, and maybe, just maybe I will make this blog look good, but since I am a complete newbie with css (And graphics design in general) I won’t do anything that looks breathtaking.

Developing sites has always been my passion over the years it’s still the thing that motivates me every day. Motivation is hard to find, and not much has happened this year (Aside of me coming out as “bisexual”). At least I have found many projects that I find cool and interesting like Revolt.chat and the fediverse.

Also, this way of writing blogs is really cool because I don’t have to worry about html tags and other caveats that frameworks have!

I will work on moving my really really old posts from my old site and move them here, so that I can use the stationarystation subdomain as my landing page for my projects and social media.

Note: This is no longer true. The blog is built using eleventy, see [Website Redesign](/blog/xenon-redesign).
