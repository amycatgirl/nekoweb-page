My first year at high school was rough. I had trouble adapting to this new environment. New curriculum, new teachers, new friends, new classes; you know, the usual.

I was an outcast on my classroom. I mean, I was the only one at the class that was friends with the so called "weirdos" of my grade... and I also was really shy to even speak to them, so I was left out of pretty much everything my classmates did.  But one thing was for certain, I was **obsessed** with tech. You couldn't see me one day without my good old trusty iPad Air that my parents gifted me for Christmas, and if you did, that would probably be as rare as catching a shiny Pokemon in a blind play-through.

As with all high schools, our principal had assigned all of us our own lockers, so we could store all of our school supplies and carry a light backpack, instead of bringing a literal brick of a backpack and possibly breaking your spine, or at the very least, slightly bend it.

I had a regular lock with a key that I used to, well, lock my locker. To be completely honest, I don't know how I managed to lose the key in less than two weeks, I had to call in one of the janitors to help me unlock my locker so I could get my Spanish notebook. Of course, he just broke the lock by using a pair of pliers.

After the incident, I had to buy a new lock to secure my things. Initially I was going to buy a combination lock, but Dad had other plans. Prior to that, he bought three fingerprint locks from Amazon for me, my sister and my slightly younger brother. He planned to gift it to us so that we could have the latest tech, at least, that was the plan.

I got my new futuristic looking, white fingerprint lock the next day. And it was awesome! Like, the fact that you can unlock a lock by *just* using your fingerprint? That was sick! I was very happy to show it off that day, flexing it in front of others like it was the last coke in the dessert.

Little did I know how easy it was to break in...

Wednesday morning, lunch break started after a *rather boring* class of geography. I packed up my things inside my locker and rushed to the table were my newfound friends hanged on, when I noticed two people going into my locker. At first glance, I didn't really care about them, they did seem suspicious though.

But then, I saw them trying to break into my locker... by pulling the lock out of it's place? And it worked??

I *had* to stop them. I ran into my locker, and tried securing it once again. I told them to scram, because it wasn't their property, but they insisted. A girl went up to me to ask about the new lock I had, and, of course, I infodumped her with all the nuts and bolts of the lock. She, being curious, asked me if she can try something out.

I said "Sure, go ahead".

I approached a ~~guy~~ that had a white lock on his hand. It seemed cool, so I asked him about it.

He gladly told me all about it, and honestly? Pretty boring.

I mean, he just went on and on about it, it was annoying!

I couldn't just *say* that what he was talking about was boring, so I interrupted him by ask him if I could try something out with the lock.

He seemed very happy when I asked that.

After getting my hands on the lock, I had a temptation to just rip it's chain apart. It seemed very fragile and wanted to see how it worked.

Unfortunately for me, the lock broke. Like, the chain slipped out of it's place.

"Oh oh", I said

`DEADNAME` was angry. He saw that his new lock, that his dad gifted him the day before, broke right in front of him.

Not knowing what to do or how to react, he did something that was completely out of his usual character of being the shy and mute kid of the classroom. **He yelled.**

He yell so hard that the principal, who was at the opposite side of the school, relative to `DEADNAME`, heard him, and went to see what was going on.

`DEADNAME` felt really sad and angry about how this happened to him, specially after not even owning it for a day. The principal asked `DEADNAME` what was going on, and why the sudden change of attitude.

"THEY BROKE MY FUCKING LOCK, PRINCIPAL!", `DEADNAME` yelled, face full of tears. "IT'S BROKEN! NONFUNCTIONAL!"

The principal then asked the girl what happened, and she explained him with a plethora of details. After thinking about what to do next for what seemed for years, he deemed that `DEADNAME`'s reaction to the situation was unacceptable on a school context and that `DEADNAME` should apologise and be on detention for two days.

To be completely honest, I had no idea of what I was thinking. 

I mean, Me? The girl-loving, catgirl? Yelling to a girl? Pffft. That's absurd.

But it happened. I remember it vividly because I felt really distressed at the moment. 

Of course, it has been years since that occurred, so I can't go into full detail on what happened next. I can't remember it very well, it's quite fuzzy.

Thankfully, something like this never happened again. At that time, I was very sensitive to everything. If you poked me, I would have literally ripped you apart, no joke. I didn't like people touching, interacting or doing anything that had to do with me and my things at the time. But I have grown up ever since then. I am a changed woman, I do many of the things myself and I am really nice to pretty much everyone I encounter.

I can have my bad days, though. Where I could not control myself, get really mad and yell to you. But I am actively trying to change that.

I am responsible of my actions and of what I say here, there and everywhere. And so should you.
