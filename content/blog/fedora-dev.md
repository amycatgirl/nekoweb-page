If you didn’t knew already, I used arch btw.

Arch has been my daily driver since the last 5 weeks and It has been going smoothly but there is one small problem with it. It isn’t the lightweight part, nor the rolling release part (I am totally fine with that). It’s that I have a growing fear of breaking my system so hard that I can’t recover any data from it.

And I don’t want to have that at the back of my spine, so I’ve switched to a much more stabler distribution of linux that you might have heard of, Fedora Linux (Version 36 with Gnome 42.1).

And for some this might be a downgrade from the absolute charm that Arch brings when you have the right to customize everything from your likings. And I find that amazing for experienced users of GNU/Linux, but I want to focus on what’s important, and that is coding.

Also, Fedora looks clean Out-Of-The-Box, no customization needed (at least for me).
