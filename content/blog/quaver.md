Again, in this post I will discuss what I am going to do for my school’s talent show and my current status as a quaver player.

So on 26 of May 2022, my school is going to do a really neat event, a talent show.

On this talent show you can do anything you want, as long as it is a talent that you have. I have a bunch of talents up of my sleeve but I think that the best talent that I can pull consistently is playing rhythm games like quaver and OSU!Mania. I decided to go with Quaver since it’s a pretty underrated rhythm game that is fully open-source and self-hostable but still a neat little game to play nowadays.

I once reached 20th place in my country after not playing for over a year, and now I am doing it again but instead of stopping at 20th place, I am going to go for 5th place, which is pretty hard and unlikely to happen. But at least I can have bragging rights for reaching such an achievement. (I mean, I reached somehow 1st place on a map I don’t even recall playing anyway, but I have an achievement for doing so.)
